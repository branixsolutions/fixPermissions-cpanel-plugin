### Currently the plugin can do the following:

#### main domain:

- change permissions to 750 and set user as owner
- change ownership over all files inside public_html
- change permissions for all directories to 755
- change permissions for all files to 644
- change permissions for all all .cgi and .pl files to 755
- change ownership for all .htaccess files

#### addon&subdomains:

- change permissions to 755 and set user as owner
- change permissions for all directories to 755
- change permissions for all files to 644
- change permissions for all all .cgi and .pl files to 755
- change ownership for all .htaccess files

### Using another cpanel template?

Default theme now is jupiter

Change the path to the fixperms.sh in index.live.php on line 38:
```/usr/local/cpanel/base/frontend/jupiter/fix/./fixperms.sh```

### Run the script for all cpanel accounts?

Use the -all flag:
```/usr/local/cpanel/base/frontend/jupiter/fix/./fixperms.sh -all```
